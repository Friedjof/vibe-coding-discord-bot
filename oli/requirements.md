* a discord bot, written in python 3.12
* it should follow professional coding styles and the program should seperate commands and message handling in a professional way
* the program should be extensible for more commands and message handling
* we want to have proper logging with sufficient logging
* the bot replies to any "morning", "good morning", "gn" with a wave emoij
* we want to have a greeting command /greetings that shows all users which have greeted this day, provide additional useful information
* when replying with wave emoij save the user, date, time and other useful information to a database (mariadb)
* use a simple, but professional way to access the database
* decide for yourself if tests are needed
* write a readme.md
